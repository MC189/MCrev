# Revision
Minecraft Windows 10 License Disabler **[Archived]**. Please use the latest version from **Releases** instead, as this old bypass already patched in `Windows 20H2+`.

# How Its Works?
The plugin just disable the License with addition .dll and xbox account routing. So you cant login xbox since its routed to Offline uses and can be customly changed on "xbox-live.json" included on the plugin.
Forgot to mention, since its disabling the online license checking.. You cant access Marketplace, realm, and server but its still work on LAN Multiplayer.

# How To Use?
Simply download all the files on this repo and copy that into Minecraft In-Game Directory
1. From there, select 1 to install Minecraft depedency first (If you doesnt have it installed on your machine) if you're not installing it, the Minecraft wont be registered and instead giving you error for missing "Microsoft.Store.Engagement.Service"
2. Select the depedency version according to your system. If your system is 64 bit, then install the x64 version and etc
3. After getting the depedency, it'll automaticly re-route you to the menu section. From here, now Install MinecraftUWP by selecting option 2 and wait until its finish registering the AppxManifest.xml

# How To Get Minecraft Dir?
